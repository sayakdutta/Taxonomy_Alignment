# Taxonomy_Alignment #
 This project not only aims to align relations in two distinct ontologies but also try to generate embeddings for each of the relations.
 
 ## How to Execute ##
 
 1)Go to PARIS/ and execute the python file to generate subsumption and equivalence probabilities.This will serve as training dataset for next step.<br/>
 2)Go to PIDGIN/ and generate the resultant graph and final alignment results as specified.<br/>
 3)Go to Embeddings/ ,generate the json file using embeddings.py and train the model .
